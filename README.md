I developed a dynamic user interface app using React.js, TailwindCSS, and Framer Motion. The app focuses on delivering a smooth and responsive user experience, with various animations and transitions that showcase the capabilities of Framer Motion. This project was created as a way to refine my skills in React and front-end development, without integrating any APIs or back-end services.
